# Empty State

Empty states are messages that users see when there is no data or content to show. They can appear
during onboarding and first time use, after successfully clearing a cue of tasks, and sometimes
during movements of failure.

## Examples

Use an empty state for educational messages, success states and cleared states, or failure states.
