# Badge

<Yard placeholderHeight={34} {...badgeYardConfig} />

Badges are small supplemental elements that highlight feature information or promotions within a user flow.

Badge content should generally be 3 words or less.

## Hierarchy

Primary badges are bright in color to grab a userâ€™s attention to an entry point of either a new product/feature, promotion or alert. Another usage is for transit lines. Avoid using multiple primary badges in the same view.

Secondary badges should be part of the content inside the component. They are often meta data, highlighted information or simplified information.

## Badges vs Tags

Badges can often be confused with tags. Although the two components are similar, the main difference is that tags are actionable and badges are not.

## Examples

<Example title="Primary inline badge" path="badge/primary-inline.js">
  <PrimaryInline />
</Example>

When placing badges inline, avoid pill badges as they may be confused with buttons.

<Example title="Secondary inline badge" path="badge/secondary-inline.js">
  <SecondaryInline />
</Example>

<Example title="Offsets" path="badge/offset.js">
  <Offset />
</Example>

There may be situations where it makes sense to deviate from the standard badge placement options. Use the offset props to manually position a badge.

- `horizontalOffset` sets the `right` CSS attribute when `placement` is `topRight` or `bottomRight`. Otherwise it sets the `left` attribute.
- `verticalOffset` sets the `top` CSS attribute when `placement` is `topLeft`, `top`, or `topRight`. Otherwise it sets the `bottom` attribute.

<Exports component={BadgeExports} title="Badge exports" path="baseui/badge" />
