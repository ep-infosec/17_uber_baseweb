# Banner

<Yard placeholderHeight={52} {...bannerYardConfig} />

A Banner is a contextual message used to communicate a state that is specific to a page or feature.
They can be at the top of a page or in line with other content. Use Banner for inline callouts,
form validation, and warning/success/failure states. For ephemeral feedback messaging, use the
[Snackbar](/components/snackbar) instead.

## Examples

Banners come in high and low contrast color combinations depending on the severity of the message.
Use lower contrast for messages with lower severity. Use higher contrast for messages with higher severity.
