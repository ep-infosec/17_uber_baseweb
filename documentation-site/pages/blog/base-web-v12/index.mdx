# Changes in Base Web@v12

The latest Base Web major release transitions the source code to typescript. No breaking runtime changes
have been included. For any project using plain javascript for flow, there should be no updates required.

Many typescript types have been updated to drop the T suffix so PropsT is now Props in most instances.
We've included backwards compatible aliases for t-suffixed types and those will be removed in a future
major release. The main backwards incompatible change of note is when using the styled function and
provide generic parameters. The params order is reversed from the previous release to align closer with
styletron.

```
// v11
const X = styled<{}, 'div'>('div', {})
// v12
const X = styled<'div', {}>('div', {})
```

Please file issues if any type errors are found.
